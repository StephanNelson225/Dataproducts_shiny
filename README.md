# Dataproducts_shiny
Coursera Data Products Assignments

This is the assignment for the Coursera Data Products Course.  Included are the ui.R and server.r code.
The www directory that the shiny app calls includes a copy of the code and brief documentation.
Also included is the data directory with a simple csv file.

In addition, the presentation hosted on rpubs is included.

Please ignore the files that are not used by the app.  They are remnants of earlier efforts.
